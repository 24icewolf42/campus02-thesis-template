@phdthesis{Aijaz2014,
abstract = {Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications is an emerging communication paradigm that provides ubiquitous connectivity between devices along with an ability to communicate autonomously without human intervention. M2M communications acts as an enabling technology for the practical realization of Internet-of-Things (IoT). However, M2M communications differs from conventional Human-to-Human (H2H) communications due to its unique features such as massive number of connected devices, small data transmissions, little or no mobility, requirements of high energy efficiency and reliability, etc. These features create various challenges for existing communication networks which are primarily optimized for H2H communications. Therefore, novel solutions are required to meet the key requirements of M2M communications. In addition, enhancements are required at different layers of the protocol stack to support co-existence of M2M devices and H2H users. The main objective of this research is to investigate the challenges of M2M communications in two broad types of M2M networks; capillary M2M and cellular M2M networks. The primary focus is on developing novel solutions, algorithms, and protocol enhancements for successfully enabling M2M communications. Since cognitive radio technology is very promising for M2M communications, special emphasis is on capillary M2M networks with cognitive radio based Physical layer. Besides, the focus is also on exploring new frontiers in M2M communications. This thesis covers different aspects of M2M communications. Considering the motivation for cognitive M2M and service requirements of M2M devices, two cognitive MAC protocols have been proposed. The first protocol is centralized in nature and utilizes a specialized frame structure for co-existence with the primary network as well as handling different Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of M2M devices. The second protocol is a distributed cognitive MAC protocol, which is specially designed to provide high energy efficiency and reliability for M2M devices operating in challenging wireless environments. Both protocols explicitly account for the peculiarities of cognitive radio environments. The protocols have been evaluated using analytical modeling and simulation studies. Recently IETF has standardized a specially designed routing protocol for capillary M2M networks, known as RPL (Routing for Low Power and Lossy Networks). RPL is emerging as the de facto routing protocol for many M2M applications including the smart grid. On the other hand, the application of cognitive radio for smart grid communication is under active investigation in the research community. Hence, it is important to investigate the applicability and adaptation of RPL in cognitive radio environments. In this regard, an enhanced RPL based routing protocol has been proposed for cognitive radio enabled smart grid networks. The enhanced protocol provides novel modifications to RPL for protecting the primary users along with meeting the utility requirements of the secondary network. An important challenge in LTE-based cellular networks with M2M communications is the uplink radio resource management as available resources are shared between M2M devices and H2H users, having different and often conflicting QoS requirements. Apart from this, energy efficiency requirements become critically important. Further, the specific constraints of Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) complicate the resource allocation problem. In this respect, an energy efficient resource allocation algorithm for the uplink of LTE networks with M2M/H2H co-existence under statistical QoS guarantees has been developed, that is based on canonical duality theory. The proposed algorithm outperforms classical algorithms in terms of energy efficiency while satisfying the QoS requirements of M2M devices and H2H users. A new frontier in M2M communications is the nano-M2M communications, which is envisioned to create the Internet-of-Nano-Things (IoNT). Molecular communication (MC) is a promising communication technique for nano-M2M communications. In literature, no model for error performance of MC exists. Therefore, an error performance model has been developed that explicitly accounts for noise and interference effects. Since relaying and network coding based solutions are gaining popularity for nano-M2M networks, the error performance of a network coded molecular nano-M2M network has been evaluated as well. Finally, the thesis is concluded based on the overall picture of the research conducted. In addition, some directions for future work are included as well.},

The most important addenda of the proposed energy efficiency evaluation framework (E3F) are a sophisticated power model for various base station types, as well as large-scale long-term traffic models. The BS power model maps the RF output power radiated at the antenna elements to the total supply power of a BS site. The proposed traffic model emulates the spatial distribution of the traffic demands over large geographical regions, including urban and rural areas, as well as temporal variations between peak and off-peak hours. Finally, the E3F is applied to quantify the energy efficiency of the downlink of a 3GPP LTE radio access network.},

Up to date, there is no standard specifically intended for low-power WBANs thus a developer is referred to use proprietary solutions which could be demanding to compare and choose. This study tries to provide the reader with the knowledge about important parameters in low-power sensor networks. Energy consumption is the really weak part of a wireless sensor network since the transceiver and other hardware equipment still drain batteries. For example the startup time for a transceiver that has been in power-down mode could consume as much as three times the energy as compared when sending the actual bits that invoked the transceiver in first place. The actual application must be the one driving the requirements on the communication. However, the application must be designed with for example the startup time in mind. A sensor network is a true cross-layer design problem where many different areas must meet such as hardware designers, application developers and communication people.},

abstract = {Two-tier femtocell networks is an efficient communication architecture that significantly improves throughput in indoor environments with low power consumption. Traditionally, a femtocell network is usually configured to be either completely open or completely closed in that its channels are either made available to all users or used by its own users only. This may limit network flexibility and performance. It is desirable for owners of femtocell base stations if a femtocell can partially open its channels for external users access. In such scenarios, spectrum and energy efficiency becomes a critical issue in the design of femtocell network protocols and structure. In this paper, we conduct performance analysis for two-tier femtocell networks with partially open channels. In particular, we build a Markov chain to model the channel access in the femtocell network and then derive the performance metrics in terms of the blocking probabilities. Based on stationary state probabilities derived by Markov chain models, spectrum and energy efficiency are modeled and analyzed under different scenarios characterized by critical parameters, including number of femtocells in a macrocell, average number of users, and number of open channels in a femtocell. Numerical and Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation results indicate that the number of open channels in a femtocell has an adverse impact on the spectrum and energy efficiency of two-tier femtocell networks. Results in this paper provide guidelines for trading off spectrum and energy efficiency of two-tier femtocell networks by configuring different numbers of open channels in a femtocell.},

abstract = {Dynamic spectrum access has been recently proposed to increase the utilization of the licensed spectrum bands, and support the constantly growing volumes of mobile traffic in the modern society. At the same time, the increasing demand for wireless connectivity, as a result of the rapid emergence of innovative wireless and mobile services, has led to the deployment of various wireless technologies in the open ISM bands. This thesis addresses the effective coexistence among the diverse wireless technologies in the above scenarios, and the energy efficiency of the deployed wireless systems, both listed among the key challenges that wireless networking is facing today. We discuss cooperative sensing, a fundamental mechanism for allowing unlicensed users perform opportunistic access in the licensed spectrum. Considering the scenario where the users perform both sensing and unlicensed spectrum access, we evaluate the efficiency of multi-channel cooperative sensing schemes with respect to the per user achievable capacity. We conclude that a careful optimization of both the number of sensed channels, and the allocation of sensing duties to the network users is necessary to achieve high capacity gains in large-scale networks of unlicensed users. We address a number of energy efficient design issues for sensor networks and wireless LANs. We study how to improve the energy efficiency of lowpower sensor networks operating under the interference from a coexisting WLAN. We propose a cognitive, cross-layer access control mechanism that minimizes the energy cost for multi-hop WSN communication, by deriving energy-optimal packet lengths and single-hop transmission distances, based on the knowledge of the stochastic channel activity patterns of the interfering WLAN. We show that the proposed mechanism leads to significant performance improvements on both energy efficiency, as well as end-to-end latency in multi-hop WSN communication, under different levels of interference. Additionally, we develop and validate the considered WLAN channel activity model and implement efficient, lightweight, real-time parameter estimation methods. We investigate how to enhance the multi-hop communication performance in ad hoc WLANs, when 802.11 stations operate under a power saving dutycycle scheme. We extend the traffic announcement scheme of the 802.11 power saving mode, allowing the stations to propagate pending frame notifications to all nodes in the end-to-end forwarding path of a network flow. We study the performance of the proposed scheme with respect to end-to-end packet delay and signaling overhead, while we investigate the impact on the achievable duty-cycle ratios of the wireless stations. For the purpose of the evaluation, and for the comparison with the standard 802.11 power saving mechanism, we implement the protocol extension in a development platform. Finally, we study how the combination of the objectives for energy efficiency and a high quality of service impacts the topology stability of selforganized ad hoc networks comprised of individual agents. Based on a noncooperative game theoretic model for topology formation, we identify key extensions in the nodes’ strategy profile space that guarantees a stable network formation under multi-objective player utility functions.},

abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an emerging low-power wireless technology developed for short-range control and monitoring applications that is expected to be incorporated into billions of devices in the next few years. This paper describes the main features of BLE, explores its potential applications, and investigates the impact of various critical parameters on its performance. BLE represents a trade-off between energy consumption, latency, piconet size, and throughput that mainly depends on parameters such as connInterval and connSlaveLatency. According to theoretical results, the lifetime of a BLE device powered by a coin cell battery ranges between 2.0 days and 14.1 years. The number of simultaneous slaves per master ranges between 2 and 5,917. The minimum latency for a master to obtain a sensor reading is 676 $\mu$s, although simulation results show that, under high bit error rate, average latency increases by up to three orders of magnitude. The paper provides experimental results that complement the theoretical and simulation findings, and indicates implementation constraints that may reduce BLE performance.},

@article{Jara2013,
abstract = {The public IPv4 address space managed by IANA (http://www.iana.org) has been completely depleted by Feb 1st, 2011. This creates by itself an interesting challenge when adding new things and enabling new services on the Internet. Without public IP addresses, the Internet of Things capabilities would be greatly reduced. Most discussions about IoT have been based on the illusionary assumption that the IP address space is an unlimited resource or it is even taken for granted that IP is like oxygen produced for free by nature. Hopefully, the next generation of Internet Protocol, also known as IPv6 brings a solution. In early 90s, IPv6 was designed by the IETF IPng (Next Generation) Working Group and promoted by the same experts within the IPv6 Forum since 1999. Expanding the IPv4 protocol suite with larger address space and defining new capabilities restoring end to end connectivity, and end to end services, several IETF working groups have worked on many deployment scenarios with transition models to interact with IPv4 infrastructure and services. They have also enhanced a combination of features that were not tightly designed or scalable in IPv4 like IP mobility, ad hoc services; etc catering for the extreme scenario where IP becomes a commodity service enabling lowest cost networking deployment of large scale sensor networks, RFID, IP in the car, to any imaginable scenario where networking adds value to commodity. For that reason, IPv6 makes feasible the new conception of extending Internet to Everything. IPv6 spreads the addressing space in order to support all the emerging Internet-enabled devices. In addition, IPv6 has been designed to provide secure communications to users and mobility for all devices attached to the user; thereby users can always be connected. This work provides an overview of our experiences addressing the challenges in terms of connectivity, reliability, security and mobility of the Internet of Things through IPv6 in order to reach the Internet of Everything. This describes the key challenges, how they have been solved with IPv6, and finally presents the future works and vision that describe the roadmap of the Internet of Everything in order to reach an interoperable, trustable, mobile, distributed, valuable, and powerful enabler for emerging applications such as Smarter Cities, Human Dynamics, Cyber-Physical Systems, Smart Grid, Green Networks, Intelligent Transport Systems, and ubiquitous healthcare.},

@phdthesis{Jonge2009,
abstract = {Executive summary KPN is the Dutch incumbent telecom provider. Through the years it has turned into a multi service provider by offering such services as internet and digital television to its customers. Due to fierce competition from mobile operators and cable companies KPN is looking for ways to increase revenues through new services. Within the home, technology and in‐home networks are increasing the possibilities to provide new services. The home of the future or ‘smart home’ is an age old promise which still hasn’t materialized. Currently there is reason to believe that the smart home is on the verge of becoming a reality, and this brings along chances for companies such as KPN. This has led to the main research question, namely: What is a robust smart home business model design for KPN in the future, and which sectors play an important role? The first step in answering this question was to do a full scan of the current possibilities within the smart home domain. This domain description has a strong technological focus. In this description I covered topics such as energy use, telemedicine, entertainment and home automation. Current standards, house cleaning robots and different forms of access technologies are named and discussed. To gain insight as to where the smart home is headed, research initiatives such as Philips ExperienceLab, two MIT research projects amongst other research initiatives, and even passionate hobbyists were visited and studied. This led to the findings that ubiquitous computing, the idea that computers are becoming cheaper, faster and more abundant, is quickly becoming reality. Together with increased intelligence and more intuitive control interfaces the technology is not the most problematic component in the realization of the smart home. Instead the greatest uncertainties lie in the standards that need to be agreed upon for such things as in home networking protocols. This standardization problem leads to integration problems of different areas within the home. Lighting, energy, media and communication are all based on their own standards and to make a complete smart home possible, these need to be integrated. Concurrently market demand is also still uncertain. If one looks at the high end home automation companies it is clear that huge sums of money are currently being spent on increasing living comfort, while new developments within the energy sector are focusing on lowering peoples bills. Together these uncertainties overshadow the fact that the technology is no longer the main bottleneck in making the smart home a reality. Moving forward I conducted futures research in the form of a trend forecast and scenario analysis. This was done based on my previous findings and the trend forecast served to create a vision of the possibilities of the future smart home, the so called future vision. Scenario analysis was used to find the most influential uncertainties over which KPN has no control. The scenarios gave an insight as to the forces which drive the factors that will affect the business model. These were based on the previously found uncertainties, the first being market demand, otherwise known as the market push or market pull. The second uncertainty came in the way innovation will be taking place. The first axis within my scenario framework had one extreme in which organizations innovate together across sectors and boundaries to develop highly innovative and disruptive products. The other extreme is that companies continue to focus on their own segments and operate in isolation within their so called stovepipes. These scenario axes left me with four distinct scenarios which I used later on to test the business models viability and robustness. The third step was to design the actual service and corresponding business model based on my findings surrounding the smart home domain. It was essential to create a service which, just as internet and television, can be sold to the masses instead of only being interesting for the early adopters and tech savvy individuals. To help me design a service concept I used a general design methodology. This service concept served as input for the STOF method, a business model theory which goes through the Service, Technology, Organization and Financial aspects to create a full business model. This method has been specifically created to design ICT based business models for new services. The design is a service delivery platform, in which KPN offers smart home services to the customer in order to promote Smart Living. These services are to be provided by third party firms and can be browsed and bought by the customer from the comfort of their own home. KPN is responsible for providing the access network, and managing the technological complexity within the home through their ‘ServiceThuis’ service. By setting transparent and clear criteria they can offer service providers high quality access to their large customer base. Based around fiber to the home access technology and experts solving customers in home technology based problems, KPN offers its customers a one‐stop‐shop where they can pick and choose services to provide a custom built service feeling. The services to be provided over such a platform come in a large variety within all the sectors that play a role within the home. Examples are governments, energy suppliers, media providers, telemedicine firms and many more. KPN will be providing the platform to offer these services, sharing in the profits of the services sold over this platform by third party firms. To make sure this business model is viable in the uncertainties the future holds, I evaluated its robustness in the different scenarios. Through critical design issues KPN can influence the critical success factors to maximize viability. The most critical success factor showed to be partner selection. The reason is that the selected partners define the services which are available over the smart home service delivery platform. Thus, in different environments it is crucial to select the partners which are going to deliver the services which are needed under the circumstances. The advice given in the end of this research gives an overview of in which sectors KPN needs to look for specific partners under the changing conditions. As an example, it is obvious that in economically uncertain times customers are less willing to purchase expensive entertainment and comfort increasing solutions, while electricity minimizing services can have a cost lowering impact. In the end I provide KPN with a service concept of a smart home service delivery platform to promote Smart Living, this can be implemented at a later stage based on their current strategy of fiber roll out and the ‘ServiceThuis’ products. In order to maximize the viability of this platform I have done futures research and designed a business model according to the STOF method. The most critical success factor according to this method is the selection of partners offering their services over the platform. This success factor has then been placed in the different scenarios in order to generate advice on which partners to select under the changing conditions. This advice is presented in the fifth chapter of my research. The very last chapter reflects on my research and provides improvements. Furthermore, this chapter provides important information on further research directions and the largest shortcomings I found in my own research. The main advice is to further evaluate my business model through interviews inside, and with potential partners, of KPN. This information provides handholds from which to further develop the smart home service delivery platform.},

To moderate the effects of network mobility, the Internet Protocol (IP) does not calculate routes; it is left to a routing protocol, which maintains routing tables in the routers. 6LowPAN uses an adaptation layer between the network (IPv6) and data link layer (IEEE802.15.4 MAC) to fragment and reassemble IPv6 packets. The routing in 6LoWPAN is primarily divided on the basis of routing decision taken on adaptation or network layer. The objective of this paper is to present a state-of-the-art survey of existing routing protocols: LOAD, M-LOAD, DYMO-Low, Hi-Low, Extended Hi-Low, and S-AODV. These routing protocols have compared on the basis of different metric like energy consumption, memory uses, mobility, scalability, routing delay, an RERR message, a Hello message, and local repair. We have also presented the taxonomy of routing requirement; parameter for evaluating routing algorithm, and it was found that the routing protocol has its own advantages depending upon the application where it is used.},

abstract = {The increasing use of wireless networks and the constant miniaturization of electrical devices has empowered the development of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). In these networks various sensors are attached on clothing or on the body or even implanted under the skin. The wireless nature of the network and the wide variety of sensors offer numerous new, practical and innovative applications to improve health care and the Quality of Life. The sensors of a WBAN measure for example the heartbeat, the body temperature or record a prolonged electrocardiogram. Using a WBAN, the patient experiences a greater physical mobility and is no longer compelled to stay in the hospital. This paper offers a survey of the concept of Wireless Body Area Networks. First, we focus on some applications with special interest in patient monitoring. Then the communication in a WBAN and its positioning between the different technologies is discussed. An overview of the current research on the physical layer, existing MAC and network protocols is given. Further, cross layer and quality of service is discussed. As WBANs are placed on the human body and often transport private data, security is also considered. An overview of current and past projects is given. Finally, the open research issues and challenges are pointed out.},

abstract = {As wireless devices boom, and bandwidth-hungry applications (e.g., video and cloud uploading) get popular, today's Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) become not only crowded but also stressed at throughput. Multi-user Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO), an advanced form of MIMO, has gained attention due to its huge potential in improving the performance of WLANs. This paper surveys random access based MAC protocols for MU-MIMO enabled WLANs. It first provides background information about the evolution and the fundamental MAC schemes of IEEE 802.11 Standards and Amendments, and then identifies the key requirements of designing MU-MIMO MAC protocols for WLANs. After that, the most representative MU-MIMO MAC proposals in the literature are overviewed by benchmarking their MAC procedures and examining the key components, such as the channel state information acquisition, de/pre-coding and scheduling schemes. Classifications and discussions on important findings of the surveyed MAC protocols are provided, based on which, the research challenges for designing effective MU-MIMO MAC protocols, as well as the envisaged MAC's role in the future heterogeneous networks, are highlighted.},

@phdthesis{Romme2008,
abstract = {It is well known that Ultra WideBand (UWB) transmission is inherently robust against small-scale-fading (SSF) that arises in multipath scattering environments, due to its large signal bandwidth. However, no model with a physical interpretation exists that relates the variations of received signal strength to the signal bandwidth and general channel parameters, like e.g. the average channel power delay profile. Such a model would be of relevance for e.g. system designers, who have to make tradeoffs between system aspects, like complexity and energy efficiency on one hand, and robustness against small-scale- fading on the other hand. In this thesis, a model is presented that allows for such a tradeoff analysis, relating the average power delay profile parameters and signal bandwidth to the statistical properties of the SSF. Additionally, it is shown how the uncoded and coded BER of BPSK modulation can be computed in a closed-form for a given average power delay profile and signal bandwidth. As stated before, UWB communication is inherently resilient against SSF. Unfortu- nately, coherent receivers become rather complex in the UWB case. In 2002, Tomlinson and Hoctor proposed to combine Transmitted Reference (TR) signaling with an auto- correlation receiver (AcR) for UWB communications, to dispose of the need for channel estimation. Due to the non-linear structure of the AcR, little was known with respect to its behaviour in various situations. This thesis aims to provide better insight in the be- haviour of such systems. Not only is the principle of TR UWB communication explained, also several extensions to the TR principle are proposed, which relieve some of its draw- backs. Additionally, novel interpretations for TR UWB systems are presented, which explain the behaviour of TR systems e.g. in the presence of inter-symbol-interference. After understanding the behaviour of TR UWB systems, the design of a high-rate TR UWB system is presented that supports data-rates up to 100 Mb/s, while occupying 1 GHz of bandwidth. Using a combination of trellis-based equalization, multiband pro- cessing, turbo equalization and turbo coding, a system is obtained which is moderately complex with respect to digital signal processing and requires an Eb/N0 of only 12 dB to obtain a BER better than 10−6.},

They are network technologies, varieties of devices, software-based systems and standards, and home gateway, the key component of a better home network. Then, the author shows several considerations from the ecological viewpoints such as cost saving, energy saving, human load saving, and data volume saving. The real technology and business for a home network is still in an evolving stage, and it is necessary to discuss the implementation issues for a home network.

We study the energy consumption of BLE by measuring real devices with a power monitor and derive models of the basic energy consumption behavior observed from the measurement results. We investigate also the overhead of Ipv6-based communication over BLE, which is relevant for future IoT scenarios. We contrast our results by performing similar measurements with ZigBee/802.15.4 devices. Our results show that when compared to ZigBee, BLE is indeed very energy efficient in terms of number of bytes transferred per Joule spent. In addition, IPv6 communication energy overhead remains reasonable. We also point out a few specific limitations with current stack implementations and explain that removing those limitations could improve energy utility significantly.},

For the 802.11ah PHY, which is designed based on the down-clocked operation of IEEE 802.11ac’s PHY layer, we describe its channelization and transmission modes. Besides, 802.11ah MAC layer has adopted some enhancements to fulfill the expected system requirements. These enhancements include the improvement of power saving features, support of large number of stations, efficient medium access mechanisms and throughput enhancements by greater compactness of various frame formats. Through the numerical analysis, we evaluate the transmission range for indoor and outdoor environments and the theoretical throughput with newly defined channel access mechanisms.},

abstract = {For decades, there exist a variety of low-power wireless technologies deployed for healthcare applications such as Zigbee/IEEE802.15.4, Bluetooth, ANT, NFC, IrDA. However, the recently announced Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology claims to offer many new compelling features and is expected to get wide adoption by many mobile manufacturers around the world and hence be included in daily life mobile devices. Therefore, it is important to provide future adopters with a thorough yet insightful evaluation of this technology as contrasted to competing ones in the market today. In this paper, we present such evaluation from an experimental point of view as well as referring to technical specifications from manufacturers. The discussion is geared toward assessing the extent to which theses technologies can meet the stringent requirements for u-healthcare applicability. BLE and 6LoWPAN showed greater potentials for such applicability in terms of power demand, bit rate and latency. Nevertheless, BLE was found to be most robust to obstacles and was operable using single coin cell.},

@article{Yang2008,
abstract = {60 GHz is considered the most promising technology to deliver gigabit wireless for indoor communications. We propose to integrate 60 GHz radio with the existing Wi-Fi radio in 2.4/5 GHz band to take advantage of the complementary nature of these different bands. This integration presents an opportunity to provide a unified technology for both gigabit Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), thus further reinforcing the technology convergence that is already underway with the widespread adoption of Wi-Fi technology. Many open research questions remain to make this unified solution work seamlessly for WPAN and WLAN.},

abstract = {Recently, the development and requirement for ultra-high data rate wireless communication applications has increased dramatically. The 60 GHz millimeter-wave wireless technology is getting increasing attention, and the IEEE 802.11 Task Group AD is making standardization efforts for multi-gigabit data rate communications on both the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers. This paper presents a performance evaluation of the PHY and MAC layers of IEEE 802.1 lad. Packet error rate and PHY throughput are presented for different modes, and the theoretical MAC throughput is analyzed for different bit error rates, packet sizes and modes. In addition, 2×2 space-time block coding (STBC) is employed for range extension. The cross layer results show our approach enhance the throughput and coverage compared to the case of single antenna.},
