\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

This \LaTeX{} template is designed for the creation of thesis documents (bachelor, master, phd) and targets both beginner and experienced users of \LaTeX{}. It supports all basic functionality and requirements of a technical document such as the inclusion of graphics, math, tables, references, bibliography and much more. In contrast to a standard LaTeX document this template not only loads all state of the art packages (\path{scientific.cls}) to provide the best functions for each task, but also includes a separate document for the style/layout of the document (\path{style.tex}). It therefore tries to separate functionallity and layout as much as possible. And the best, everything is documented in the code.
